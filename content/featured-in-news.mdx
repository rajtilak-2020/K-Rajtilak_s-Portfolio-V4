I am excited to share that I was recently featured in a news broadcast for participating in the Energy Conservation Day 2023 Poster Presentation. This prestigious event, organized by the Institute of Engineers (India), highlighted innovative ideas aimed at promoting energy conservation and sustainability.
                        Being part of this competition was a rewarding experience where I contributed my efforts alongside other passionate participants. Showcasing my ideas and creativity in addressing energy-related challenges.
                        Moments like these inspire me to continue working on projects that drive change and make an impact. Iâ€™m grateful for the support from my mentors, peers, and DRIEMS Polytechnic, who have guided me throughout this journey.
                        Stay tuned for more updates as I continue exploring opportunities to innovate and contribute to a sustainable future! ðŸŒ±âœ¨
